# It's not recommended to modify this file in-place, because it will be
# overwritten during upgrades.  If you want to customize, the best
# way is to use the "systemctl edit" command to create an override unit.

# For example, to pass additional options, create an override unit
# (as is done by systemctl edit) and enter the following:

#     [Service]
#     Environment=OPTIONS="-l 127.0.0.1,::1"


[Unit]
Description=memcached daemon

# Set up a new file system namespace and mounts private /tmp and /var/tmp directories
# so this service cannot access the global directories and other processes cannot
# access this service's directories.

# Mounts the /usr, /boot, and /etc directories read-only for processes invoked by this unit.

# Sets up a new /dev namespace for the executed processes and only adds API pseudo devices
# such as /dev/null, /dev/zero or /dev/random (as well as the pseudo TTY subsystem) to it,
# but no physical devices such as /dev/sda.
