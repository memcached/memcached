## Dependencies

* libevent - https://www.monkey.org/~provos/libevent/ (libevent-dev)
* libseccomp (optional, experimental, linux) - enables process restrictions for
  better security. Tested only on x86-64 architectures.
* openssl (optional) - enables TLS support. need relatively up to date
  version.

## Environment

Be warned that the -k (mlockall) option to memcached might be
dangerous when using a large cache. Just make sure the memcached machines
don't swap.  memcached does non-blocking network I/O, but not disk.  (it
should never go to disk, or you've lost the whole point of it)

## Build status

See https://build.memcached.org/ for multi-platform regression testing status.
