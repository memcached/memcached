# Memcached

Memcached is a high performance multithreaded event-based key/value cache
store intended to be used in a distributed system.

## Dependencies

* libevent, http://www.monkey.org/~provos/libevent/ (libevent-dev)
* libseccomp, (optional, linux) - enables process restrictions for better
  security.

## Environment

Be warned that the -k (mlockall) option to memcached might be
dangerous when using a large cache.  Just make sure the memcached machines
don't swap.  memcached does non-blocking network I/O, but not disk.  (it
should never go to disk, or you've lost the whole point of it)
