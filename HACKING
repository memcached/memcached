# Hacking Memcached

* Prerequisites

 - autoconf
 - automake
 - autotools
 - libevent

* Getting Started

After checking out a git repository, you must first run autogen.sh
once in order to create the configure script.

Next, run the configure script and start doing builds.

* Setting up Git

Though not required, there are a couple of things you can add to git
to help development.

** Pre Commit Hook

The pre-commit hook can be used to ensure that your tree passes tests
before allowing a commit.  To do so, add the following to
.git/hooks/pre-commit (which must be executable):

    #!/bin/sh
    make test

** Post Commit Hook

Because the version number changes on each commit, it's good to use a
post commit hook to update the version number after each commit so as
to keep the reporting accurate.  To do so, add the following to
.git/hooks/post-commit (which must be executable)

    #!/bin/sh
    ./version.sh

** Running memcached in gdb for tests.

By default `make test` will spawn a memcached daemon for each test.
This doesn't let you easily drop into gdb or run verbosely.

If you export the environment variable
T_MEMD_USE_DAEMON="0.0.0.1:1234" the tests will use an existing
daemon at that address.
